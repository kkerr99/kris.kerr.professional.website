For example, in a perfect world the action of "a customer buys bread, peanut butter, and jelly" always causes the creation (output result) of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. However, there is a large gap between causation and correlation. In the real world, the best that can be typically done is to find input features that are correlated with predicted outputs. In the real world, the action of "a customer buys bread, peanut butter, and jelly" is strongly correlated with the output of a peanut butter sandwich, but some customers may make peanut butter toast, and eat jelly with a spoon (or some variation thereof). Various studies have indicated the presence of a full moon to be correlated with an increase in crime. This does not necessarily mean that a full moon causes more crime to happen.

PII is generally understood as a collection of sensitive material which, taken together, would be sufficient to locate, contact, or otherwise identify a single person. PII data is subject to extensive regulation in the United States (which varies by state), the European Union (under the umbrella of the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR), and many other countries. Due to its sensitivity, PII should never be included in a model. Filter out all PII fields from a data set before you upload it to AML. Beyond that consideration, names are generally considered identifiers instead of descriptors. As such they have very limited use as input features for predictive models.
