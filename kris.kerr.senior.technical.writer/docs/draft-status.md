Whenever you edit a project (new or existing), the project status is changed to `Draft`.

A new project is assigned a version value of 1. If you edit an existing project and save the changes, the project version number is incremented by 1. Previous versions of projects are saved, and you can access them through:

- The **All Versions** link on the **Project Manager** page project card.

- The **Version** dropdown menu on a project **Solutions** page.

**Note:**

If you edit a project that has completed training (change the project status from **Completed** to **Draft**), the metrics on the **Project Manager** page project card are no longer displayed. This is a known issue, and will be corrected in a future software version.
