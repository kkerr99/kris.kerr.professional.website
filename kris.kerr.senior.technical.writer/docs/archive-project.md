In the AML paradigm, projects are never deleted. You can always go back and view a previously-created project. But if you want to un-deploy a model, you can archive it. Archived projects are not shown by default (but you can change this setting in the project query section).

1. Hover over the project’s pulldown menu and select **Archive Project**.

2. A confirmation dialog is displayed. Click **Archive**.

3. The project is archived. You can search for an archived project on the **Project Manager** page by selecting **Archived Projects** in the project search criteria section.
