When you first log on to rgOne, the main viewing area displays the Widget dashboard, which is comprised of widgets you have previously enabled and configured. You can define more than one Widget dashboard. You may also have one or more dashboards that have been previously created by another user and assigned to your user role.

You can navigate directly to the Widget dashboard from an app page by clicking the Widget dashboard link on the left vertical navigation bar.

If you have not added any widgets to your dashboard, or you don't have any dashboards assigned to your role, the Widget dashboard will be empty.
