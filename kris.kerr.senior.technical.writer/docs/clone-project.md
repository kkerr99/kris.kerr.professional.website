Cloning a project is useful for "what-if" scenarios. You can change any settings in a cloned project, and the original project is not modified. Cloning allows you to easily branch off an existing project.

1. Hover over the project’s pulldown menu and select **Clone Project**.

3. Click **Clone Project**. Note that on the **Configure Project** page, you can keep the project section settings from the parent project, or you can change them.
