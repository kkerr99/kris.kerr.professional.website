Before we continue, let's distinguish between a *model* and a *solution*. In theory they refer to the same thing (a mathematical function that takes input data and generates output data), but the name changes depending upon where it is in its life cycle. In AML, the initial models a project generates are called *solutions*. When one of these solutions is published and can be used for prediction, we refer to it as a *model*.
