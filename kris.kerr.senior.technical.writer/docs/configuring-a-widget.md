You initially configure a widget as part of the widget creation process. However, you can always go back and change a widget's configuration values.

To change an existing widget's configuration values:

1. Click the widget's menu icon and select **Configuration**.
2. On the widget **Configuration** popup dialog, change configuration values and/or options.
5. Click **OK**.
