The rationale behind collecting copious amounts of customer data is to identify and leverage the information contained within it to provide the best possible, personalized customer experience. Knowing your customers' behavioral patterns allows you to make informed decisions when interacting with your customers in the future.

The amount of data collected about your customers and their behavior is huge and is constantly growing. Trying to manually find patterns within this vast amount of data can be very difficult.

Instead of trying to find data patterns yourself, you can use Machine Learning (ML, aka Artificial Intelligence/AI). In ML/AI, computers use mathematical algorithms to quickly find patterns among vast amounts of data. 

One of the key concepts of ML/AI is that it allows the data to suggest the best method to recognize useful patterns instead of imposing human ideas and assumptions that may not be suited to the underlying data.

AML gives you the ability to use machine learning on your data without requiring data scientist-level expertise.

- If you have a solid understanding of the data or marketing process (are a *data citizen*), you can get involved with data modeling through AML.
- If you want to go deeper and tweak the machine learning process, AML gives you the tools to do so.
- AML hides the complexity of data modeling behind an easy-to-use, guided workflow where only critical decisions about the model need to be made by the data citizen.
