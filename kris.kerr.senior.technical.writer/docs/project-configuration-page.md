When creating a project, after you choose whether to base the project on a template or a model, the **Project Configuration** page is displayed. It displays (at a high level) a project's current settings, which are split into sections.

When creating a new project, or when not actively training a project, you can edit the settings in each section.

**Note:**
- You can edit sections in any order.
- You are required to edit only the **Data File** and **Inputs/Outputs** sections.
- Editing all other sections is optional, and these sections have reasonable default settings for most common cases.
