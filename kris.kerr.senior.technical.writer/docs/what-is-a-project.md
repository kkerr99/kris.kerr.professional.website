In a nutshell, a project is the atomic unit of AML. It also:

- Defines all the constraints used when generating a set of solutions. Solutions generated by a project can be reviewed, discarded, or published. A user may want to experiment with different project constraints to see how these changes affect the solutions that are created.
- Provides the mechanism for tracking the different versions of constraints used when generating solutions.
