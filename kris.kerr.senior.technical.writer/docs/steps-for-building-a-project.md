In general, these are the steps for building an AML project:

1. On the **Project Manager** page, click **New Project**.
2. Give the project a name and description, and select a category.
3. Choose whether to create a project from an existing template or a basic model type.
4. Select the model training files (which may require you to upload the training data to AML).
5. Select the model’s input and output features. (A *feature* is a single column from the input data file.)
