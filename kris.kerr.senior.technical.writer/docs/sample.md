`Sample` determines what percentage of a data set is used for training, and what percentage is used for testing, according to the formulas:

% data set used for training = `sample`

% data set used for testing = `(1 - sample)`

A default value of 0.5 means 50% of a data set will be used for training and 50% will be used for testing.

A value of 0.3 means that 30% of a data set will be used for training and 70% used for testing.
