The Project Manager page (aka *Project Manager*) is used to manage AML projects. Specifically, this page allows you to do the following things with projects:

- create
- edit
- stop and resume training
- view project settings
- archive
- clone
- view a project's fitness report
- view a list of the project's generated solutions

Clicking the **Refresh** icon queries the database for any state changes, using the current dashboard filters. It is especially useful when periodically checking the progress of projects in training. We recommend that you use the dashboard **Refresh** icon because this updates the dashboard much faster than refreshing the entire page using the browser refresh button.
