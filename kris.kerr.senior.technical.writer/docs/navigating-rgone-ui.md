When you first log on to rgOne, the rgOne dashboard page is displayed. This dashboard displays previously-enabled and -configured widgets. Depending upon the installation, you might create your own rgOne dashboard, or an administrator might create this dashboard for you.

Every rgOne page includes a left vertical navigation bar that displays icon links to your installed rgOne apps, as well as an icon link to the rgOne dashboard. You can navigate between app pages, or between an app page and the rgOne dashboard, at any time by clicking one of these icon links.

When you click an rgOne app icon, the app section icons are displayed on the navigation bar. Click on an app section icon to display the associated page in the main workspace to the right.
