If one or more section lights are red:
- The project status at the top of the page displays the message `Invalid`.
- The project is not ready to train.
- Change the settings in each invalid section to make that section valid (the section light will turn green).

When all of the section lights are green, the project is ready to train.
- The project status at the top of the page displays the message `Valid`.
- You can start training the project by clicking the **Start Training** button.
