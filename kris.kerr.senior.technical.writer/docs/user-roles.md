In rgOne, a user is assigned permission to do things through roles. Each role is assigned one or more atomic permissions, such as the ability to create a project or publish a solution.

For example, you could create a role named `Clone any Project` with the assigned permissions `Create Project` and `View all Projects`. Then you could assign that role to one or more users.
