The Regression model uses a set of input features to predict output features. Input features can be continuous (floating point), discrete (integer), text (turned into enumerated integer values), and binary (0/1). The output features to predict must be continuous values.

Regression models can be used to predict things like:

- profit
- potential sales
- transaction volume
- credit score

A regression model performs supervised learning, meaning that models are trained with known results that are presumed to be correct (and most importantly, correlated with the input features).

Multiple outputs are independent of each other.

**Note:** Only certain training algorithms (for example, neural networks) can produce multiple output values simultaneously.
