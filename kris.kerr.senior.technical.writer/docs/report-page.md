Clicking the **Report** tab on the **Solutions** page displays the project's training score vs. generation graph. This is the same graph that is displayed from the **Project Manager** page if you hover over a project's pulldown menu and select **Fitness Report**.

See [Analyzing a project's training results](analyzing-a-projects-training-results) for an explanation of this graph.
