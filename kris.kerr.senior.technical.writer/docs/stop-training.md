You can stop the project training process in the following situations:

- While the project is in the training queue (project status is **In Queue**).
- While the project is actively training (project status is **Training**).
- While the project setting **Automate Runs** is selected, meaning that the project is scheduled to train in the future (project status is **Scheduled**).

**Note:** Projects in which training is stopped before completion are still usable projects. You could set a project to train for 24 hours, but after 16 hours think "I need this now", stop training, and publish one or more of the project's generated solutions.

1. Hover over the project's pulldown menu and select **Stop Training**.
