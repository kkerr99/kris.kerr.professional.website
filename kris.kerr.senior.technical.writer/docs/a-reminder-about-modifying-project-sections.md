As we mentioned before, after you edit a project's **Data File** and **Inputs/Outputs** sections, AML populates the rest of the project sections with reasonable default settings for most common cases. Editing these other sections is optional, though you can if you want to.

See [Project settings and UI overview](project-settings-and-ui-overview) for descriptions of the settings in these other sections.
