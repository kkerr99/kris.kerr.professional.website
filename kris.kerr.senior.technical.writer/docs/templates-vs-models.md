There are two ways to create a project in AML:

- Choose a template from a list of business problems you want to solve. Each of these templates is optimized to solve a specific problem, such as "predict customer sales" or "predict yearly/monthly spend".
- Choose a basic data model type.

In either case, AML chooses initial project settings to get you started quickly.
