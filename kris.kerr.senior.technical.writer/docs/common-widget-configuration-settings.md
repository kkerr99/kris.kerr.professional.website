Every widget has a **Widget Configuration** section with the same settings:

![Widget configuration section](/img/widget-configuration-section.png "Widget configuration section")

## Widget Title
The displayed title of the widget.

## Min Column Size / Max Column Size
## Min Row Size / Max Row Size
These settings limit how the widget can be resized on the Widget dashboard.

Deselecting all rows on **Min Row Size** and **Max Row Size** removes sizing limits.

## Preview
