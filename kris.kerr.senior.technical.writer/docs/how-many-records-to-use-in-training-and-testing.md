If you're using a single data file for training and testing, what percentages you use for each action depends on how many records you have. If you have a large data set, you may only need a small percentage of a file for training and testing (because using more records would be overkill). If you have a small data file, you would probably use a larger percentage of the file for each action, because you need a minimum number of records for decent training and testing.
