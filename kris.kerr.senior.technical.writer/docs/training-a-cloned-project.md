You can clone a trained project and resume training the clone from the original project’s completion point. That is to say:

- The original project must have successfully completed training at least once.
- If you clone this project and resume training the clone, the clone uses as the parents of the first generation the *n* top-scoring solutions from the original trained project (where *n* = number of parents in the project).
